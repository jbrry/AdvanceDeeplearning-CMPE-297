# Requirements
a) Write a colab with a very simple and easy  MTL task (multi task learning) - Hints. check slides for some examples, or  link1 (Links to an external site.) , link2 (Links to an external site.) link3 (Links to an external site.)

b) Write a colab for very simple and easy meta learning task (i provided so many links to colabs for omniglot - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hWCzgx8ZpjXE8WZMDwclSHDwYSvPDpD0Dq5PYweOvJ8/edit#slide=id.g98c7d1ce68_16_67 (Links to an external site.)  , reptile demo from keras.io etc.,. - please use any as sample).

 

Use github directory and submit it like you always do with proper comments, visualization, metrics etc.,. properly done.

please clearly write what you are submitting with links in read.me file in directory. properly checkin executed colabs with results (not just raw colabs).

 

Extra points (optional) - will go to extra credit :

c) Write colab to demo the use of pre trained multi model multi task learning model from ibm (refer to my slides - omninet). Demo zeroshot learning there.

d) write colabs to demo various meta learning algorithms with simple examples - prototype networks, matching networks, relational networks

e) write colabs to demo fomaml and reptile demos

f) implement colab for keras mmoe demo (see slides)

g) write a colab to demo the BERT MTL framework  (see slides) with custom task added to list

h) write a colab for demoing multi-task-NLP framework (see slides) with just task config

i) Write a colab to demo emmental MTL - chexnet, superglue examples

j) Write a colab to demo ANML meta learning
